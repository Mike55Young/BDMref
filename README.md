# BDMref
Reformat the output of Australian Births Deaths and Marriages websites as references for Genealogy websites like WikiTree.
To be able to run this you need to have Python 3 installed. It was developed on Python version 3.8
When you run BDMref.pyw it should open a small window showing buttons to select a state and an input area.

When one of the state buttons is clicked further buttons are added below the input box.
Once you have copied a single record line from the BDM website and pasted it in the input box,
click on one of the added buttons to generate the formatted reference and copy it to the clipboard.
The generated text is also shown at the bottom of the window.

Victoria has a field in the BDM output for the type of record, so only one button is required.
For NSW you need to tell the program what type of record you are viewing, so there are three buttons, one for each type.
