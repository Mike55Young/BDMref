Contributing to this project.

This project is currently quite small by GIT standards so I'm not expecting to need code collaboration.

If you find anything you think is a bug, or wish to request additional features, feel free to raise them on GIThub.
For bugs the state being searched and the search keys used plus the browser you are using should be mentioned so I can reproduce the problem myself.

I will also consider requests for new output formats if given some samples of the birth, death and marriage outputs you want.

If you have created your own format file that you think might be useful to others, feel free to add it to the repository but give it a new name (if I really like it I might at some stage make it the default).
