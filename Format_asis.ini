BDMref Output Format templates

This file contains the formatting for the output of BDMref. It is divided into three sections, with headings Birth, Death and Marriage.
This text, before the line containing "Birth" on its own, is ignored by the program.

Mutiple format files are permitted and are selected by the line Format=filename in the file Config.ini

The templates in this file contain text, and variable sections enclosed in braces {}.
The variable sections are only inserted if there is a variable within them that has a value.

The basic variable section has the layout {prefix text|variable name,options|suffix text}
The prefix and suffix text is only output if the variable has a value.
Sets of related variables can be further grouped in nested braces. This set will only be omitted if all the varables within it are empty.
For example: {, Mother:{ |mother family,U|,}{ |mother,C|}}

Option values
	Omitted: variable is inserted exactly as shown on the website
	U: Variable is output in UPPER CASE
	C: Variable is output with words Capitalised
	L: Variable is output in lower case
